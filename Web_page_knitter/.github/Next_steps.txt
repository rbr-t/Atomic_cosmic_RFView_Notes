Next steps:
    1. Knit files in a folder to a web-page view 
    2. Summarize files to suit different overview formats
    3. Assign key-words, prepare and attach metadata
        a. Ability to connect and chat about the generated reports with LLMs
        b. security strategy and implementation especially while chatting with LLMs
        c. Ability to re-arrange the toc based on keywords or workflows
        d. Ability to edit files from the web-page
    4. Generate work flow and prompts for indivudual reports/files
    5. Identifiy commonolities, use the toc as big pictrue to define common goal
    6. Generate master workflow and link to indivudual workflows
    7. Define goals for app development
        a. structure
        b. functionality
        c. data Management
        d. UI elements definition
        e. Scale & speed
    8. Generate detailed prompts for the app development
        a. Organize promts for use/re-use with appropirate searchable keywords
        b. Store prompts in a structured format for future use (prompt library)
    9. Generate app code using appropriate LLM
        a. Use of workflows, models and agents
    10. Test strategy and automated testing of the app and documentation
    11. How to reuse apply methodology for other applications.
    12. Master app/workspae which acts as a library of inidvudual apps and shares resources for efficiency.
    13. Machine learnign and model the app process
