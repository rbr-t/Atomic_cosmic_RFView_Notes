About the job
Very good salary to be negociated.



We are hiring a RF Engineer (Radio Frequency Engineer) for a leading satellite constellation manufacturer based in Finland (Helsinki) that designs, builds, and operates the world’s most advanced constellation of Earth observation satellites. With headquarters in Europe and offices across multiple continents, the organization brings together more than 600 professionals from nearly 60 countries — united by a shared mission: to harness space technology for the benefit of life on Earth.


The company’s satellites provide images of our planet day and night, in any weather conditions, delivering persistent monitoring capabilities unmatched in the industry. These insights empower government and commercial partners to make critical, data-driven decisions in areas such as maritime, disaster response, insurance, and finance.


Why should you join ?

This is a place where cutting-edge technology meets meaningful impact. The company is continuously expanding and joining the team means working alongside highly skilled, diverse colleagues who are shaping the future of the NewSpace industry.




What will you do in this role?

You will work closely with engineers from other domains to design a new generation of satellites and ensure continuous improvements of them.
Your responsibilities will include designing and testing satellite RF hardware, tackling the challenges inherent in the new space engineering approach, and pushing the boundaries of what small sensing satellites can achieve.
You will also be involved in the design of both passive and active microwave systems, and provide technical support for our expanding fleet of satellites. If you're ready to take on these exciting challenges, we’d love to have you on board.
